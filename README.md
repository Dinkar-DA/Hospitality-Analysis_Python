# Exciting Update on My Python Journey! üêç

Welcome to my GitHub repository! Here, I share my ongoing learning experience with Python. Below is an overview of the key concepts I've covered and the projects I've completed.

## Core Concepts

- **Variables**: Understanding how to store and manipulate data.
- **Strings**: Working with text data and performing various operations.
- **Loops**: Implementing different types of loops for repetitive tasks.
- **Functions**: Creating reusable blocks of code.
- **Conditional Statements**: Using `if` conditions to control the program flow.
- **Data Structures**: Exploring lists, tuples, and dictionaries, along with their use cases.

## Object-Oriented Programming

- **Classes and Objects**: Delved into the fundamentals of OOP, including inheritance and exception handling, to manage errors effectively.

## Data Manipulation with NumPy

- Explored basic and matrix operations to understand their significance in data science.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Utilized libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data exploration, cleaning, transformation, and insight generation.

## Project Overview

In my latest project, I employed various data exploration techniques to detect errors and developed functions for data cleaning and transformation. I used the `apply` function in DataFrames to deepen my understanding of inbuilt functions and their operations. All methods and reasoning behind my approach are documented in a detailed PDF.

## Repository Contents

In this repository, you will find:

- All datasets I worked on
- The IPYNB file containing the project code
- A detailed PDF documenting my methods and findings

Thank you for visiting my repository! Feel free to explore and reach out with any questions or feedback.
